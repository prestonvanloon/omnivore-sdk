    Adds a new Ticket Item to a Ticket.

    Ticket Items inherit values from their Menu Item parents. It is required to attach a Menu Item to a Ticket Item when adding to a Ticket.

    Ticket Items can be submitted with modifiers to override their default Menu configurations. (Example - Extra Ketchup)

    Ticket Items can also be submitted with discounts that will apply to the newly created item.

    Several Ticket Items can be created at a time by passing multiple input objects together as an array. The example payload on the right shows this.
